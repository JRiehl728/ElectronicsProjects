# Electronics Projects Portfolio

This page is dedicated to sharing the various electronics projects i have designed and built over my years of experimenting.

## My First Circuitry 

The first circuit i built was a basic Darlington Array based touch switch. This switch was operated by touching two metal contacts at the same time, thus turning on a light or other load. This project was a great intro to the basics of electronics as it taught me the workings of a very important circuit in electronics all with simple physical components.
