# Electronics Projects Portfolio

This page is dedicated to sharing the various electronics projects i have designed and built over my years of experimenting.

## My First Circuitry - Darlington Touch Switch

The first circuit i built was a basic Darlington Array based touch switch. This switch was operated by touching two metal contacts at the same time, thus turning on a light or other load. This project was a great intro to the basics of electronics as it taught me the workings of a very important circuit in electronics all with simple physical components.

## Up-Cycled 3D Printer(Unfinished)

I have torn apart many PCs throughout my time salvaging and experimenting with electronics and I ended up with a plethora of discarded CD/ROM drives. I began wondering what I could do with these drives other than just ripping out the lasers and throwing the rest in a pile. I started to research some options and the most common use I came upon was using the stepper motor driven laser carriages as the axis for a mini 3D printer.

I started out by measuring the CD drive motor carriages and designing frame pieces in a CAD program.

I then attached the carriages and assembled the frame parts. I fabricated the bed from a small piece of MDF that I covered in aluminum foil tape to give a smooth impervious surface to print the plastic on.

## Pellet Stove Daughter Board Repair

My parents have been using a pellet stove to heat their home for quite sometime now and after hundreds if not thousands of times being switched on and off, the buttons on the control panel started to work less frequently.

My Dad had priced out a new board from a local dealer and when he heard the nearly $200 price tag for the glorified slab of fiberglass, he came to me to fix it.

Luckily there was a button that my dad never used on the board so the procedure was relatively simple. I desoldered both of the SMD momentary switches, the broken one for power and the one that had never been used.

From there I swapped the switches and resoldered them into place on the board.

I then reinstalled the board into the stove and it turned on no problem. A relatively quick fix to save nearly $200.
