## Electronics Projects Portfolio

This page is dedicated to sharing the various electronics projects i have designed and built over my years of experimenting.

# My First Circuitry #

The first circuit i built was a basic Darlington Array based touch switch. This switch was operated by touching two metal contacts at the same time, thus turning on a light or other load.
